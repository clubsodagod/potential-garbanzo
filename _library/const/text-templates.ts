    "Hi [First Name], this is Maliek. I came across a foreclosure notice on your property at [Address] and just wanted to reach out. I help homeowners in situations like this avoid credit damage or walk away with cash. No pressure — would you be open to hearing what your options look like?",
    "Just checking in, [First Name] — I know this may not be easy to talk about. I’ve helped others avoid foreclosure or sell with dignity, even if they were behind. If you'd like me to run through your options (no cost), I’m happy to help. Reply “info” and I’ll send details.",
    "Hi again [First Name] — I may have a couple buyers interested in homes like yours before they hit auction. If selling’s not the goal, I can still connect you with a foreclosure specialist. Totally up to you, just don’t want you to miss the chance to control the outcome."
